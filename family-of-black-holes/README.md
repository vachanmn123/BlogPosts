A black hole is a region of space so dense that gravity is so strong that we would have to travel faster than the speed of light to escape the pull of gravity after a point. That point is known as the event horizon or point of no return. What's inside a black hole is still not known to us but there have been innumerable hypotheses. Till date we've discovered 5 types of black holes two of which are hypothetical and 3 have been observed using telescopes

### Types of black holes 
1.Primordial black holes:

Black holes are simply an accumulation of excessive matter in a very confined space which can also be made using few micrograms of material but packed very closely. Their masses can be far below stellar mass. Primordial black holes could have masses as low as 10-5 grams, which is about 100,000 times less than a paperclip. The formation of such black holes can be explained by the fact that during the big bang the matter was uneven and chaotic. This chaos causes fluctuations in density. Even if the region was 10% denser they would start attracting other stellar matter that would collapse to form a primordial black hole. The size of this black hole is about the width of a human hair. Stephen Hawking worked out the theory. But they're still hypothetical, scientists haven't discovered a primordial black hole that small. There are theories of primordial black holes accounting for the extra matter known as dark matter, but it hasn't been proven yet. Back in 2019, a study suggested primordial black hole in our solar system orbiting way out in the edge as the 9th planet way beyond Neptune.

2.Stellar mass black hole:

Stellar mass black holes are the most common type of black holes. They form when massive stars run out of fuel and hence have no  force to counteract gravity pulling the matter inwards. This causes the star to collapse and  go supernova. But this does not happen with every star. For instance the Sun wouldn't undergo supernova as it isn't massive enough. The minimum mass required for a star to undergo supernova is 20 times the mass of the sun. They typically weigh between five to ten times the mass of the Sun Stars are majorly made up of hydrogen and the hydrogen that's present on the outside doesn't completely collapse into a black hole. It rebounds off the core to give nebula remnants. Right in the middle is the core of the star that can't resist the gravitational force and collapses into a stellar mass black hole. Unlike primordial black holes these aren't hypothetical and have been observed by telescopes.

3. Supermassive black holes

This is the first direct image of a supermassive black hole located at the galactic core of [Messier 87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87).

These black holes are gigantic and are located at the very centres of galaxies. They're astonishingly gigantic with their size ranging from millions to billions of times the mass of the sun. There are a few theories that explain the formation of super massive black holes such as stellar mass black holes merging colliding to become a super massive black hole. Or like primordial Black holes they formed in the very early universe directly without the merging of stellar mass black holes. This process skips the star forming, going supernova, turning into stellar masses then turning into a super massive black hole. The Earth orbits the sun and the Sun orbits the centre of the milky way, and right at the of the milky way is a super massive black hole. Theories state that every galaxy has a super massive black hole at its centre. Decades have been spent on studying the position of stars at the centre of the galaxy to prove the existence of a black hole at the centre of the galaxy. As for the milky way galaxy, the Sun takes 250 million yrs to make an orbit around the centre. It was observed that the closest stars to the black hole make one full orbit in just 12 yrs travelling at an immense 8% of speed of light. The object that the star was orbiting was 4 million times the mass of the sun, fit in a space smaller than the solar system. The object was emitting no light hence it had to be a super massive black hole. The James Webb space telescope might help us understand the formation of super massive black holes.

4.Quasars:

Quasars are believed to be formed when matter is tossed near the event horizon of a super massive black hole which is eventually gulped by it to form massive quasars. They're abnormally huge and weigh more than billion times the mass of the sun. These quasars keep getting bigger and brighter and eject x-rays and uv rays. They contribute to the brightest objects in our universe and often look like extremely black stars. Hence its name quasi stellar objects which means almost star like objects. In a way they're just incredibly greedy black holes. 

5.Intermediate mass black hole:

As the name suggests they form an intermediate between stellar mass black holes. and super massive black holes. They weigh more than stellar mass black holes but less than super massive black holes. Their mass ranges from 100 to 1000 solar masses. A black hole of that size hasn't been discovered yet, but if super massive black holes form due to the collision of stellar mass black holes there must be an intermediate stage too. Theories suggest that dwarf galaxies might have intermediate mass black holes. These black holes are much smaller and hence do not glow as bright as super massive black holes therefore making them hard to detect. The research is still pending and we've come a long way but there's still a lot left to discover.
